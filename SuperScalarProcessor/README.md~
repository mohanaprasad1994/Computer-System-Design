 This code implements a super scalar processor simulator with all the necessary components to support multi-instruction issue, out-of-order execution, in-order commit, operand forwarding, load bypassing, load forwarding, structural hazards handling, and false dependency elimination.
 
 TO run:
 $ make
 $ ./main <input file>
 
 There is no GUI support for this code. We hope to extend it later.
